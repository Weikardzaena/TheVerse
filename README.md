# Welcome to TheVerse
TheVerse is a Forge-Modded Minecraft server. We use a special launcher to insure that all the clients have the latest mods and config files so that all users have a fun expereince!

If you would like to play with us on the server please let me know by sending me your Minecraft username so that I can whitelist you on the server!

### Running

All you need to do to get connected to the server is extract the zip file to a location on your computer that you choose. The entire application is portable and will not create any files outside it's own folder.

1. Make sure you have Jave 8 64 bit installed on your computer. You can do so by going to the [java downloads page.](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
2. Extract TheVerse-master.zip to your comptuer and navigate to the folder.
3. Double click <OS>_Start where <OS> Is the operating system you are running (Windows, Linux, or Mac).
2. If you're on Mac and you don't have xcode installed the launcher will prompt you to install it now.
3. Log-in and click 'Launch'
    * If this is your first time launching it could take up to 10 minutes to download all the neccessary files. This long launch time will only occur the first time.

### Advanced Minecraft Properties

To make minecraft run optimally you should configure optifine. To do that, after you connect click "esc" then "Options..." then "Video Settings..."

Here are some settings that will make it look good on almost any computer: Graphics: Fancy Smooth Lighting: Minimum Smooth Lighting Level: 100% GUI Scale: Auto Brightness: Moody Fog: Fast 3d Anaglyph: OFF Render Distance: 12 Normal+ Max Framerate: VSync (all the way to the left) View Bobbing: ON Advanced OpenGL: Fancy Clouds: ON Fog Start: 0.8

In "Details...": Clouds: Default Trees: Default Water: Default Sky: ON Sun & Moon: ON Depth Fog: ON Translucent Blocks: Fast Cloud Height: OFF Grass: Default Rain & Snow: Fast Stars: ON Show Capes ON Held Item Tooltips: ON Dropped Items: Default

click done. In "Animations...": click "All ON" change Particles to 'Decreased'

click done. In "Quality...": MipMap Levels: 3 (any higher doesn't do anything with our texturepack) Anisotropic Filtering: OFF Clear Water: OFF Better Grass: OFF Custom Fonts: ON Swamp Colors: ON Connected Textures: Fancy Mipmap Type: NEarest Custom Sky: OFF Random Mobs: ON Better Snow: OFF Custom Colors: ON Smooth Biomes: ON Natural Textures: OFF

click done. In "Performance...": Smooth FPS: ON Load Far: OFF Chunk Updates: 1 Fast Math: ON Fast Render: ON Smooth World: ON Preloaded Chunks: OFF Dynamic Updates: ON Lazy Chunk Loading: ON

click done. In "Other..." Lagometer: OFF Weather: ON Fullscreen: OFF Autosave: 3min Debug Profiler: OFF Time: Default Fullscreen Mode: Default

Click done, done, done, and back to game! Note, the game runs faster if you click f11 and make it fullscreen, but don't change that option in optifine otherwise the game may have trouble starting.

### Advanced Information

When the program launches it will allocate itself 4 GiB of ram and assume that you have 4 threads. In the future a configuration optionj will be availabe to allow you to change this.

### Users not on TheVerse
